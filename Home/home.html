                        Rett syndrome is a <b>rare neurological genetic disorder</b> that affects the development of the
                        brain,
                        resulting in severe
                        physical and intellectual disabilities. It affects children (especially females) in the early
                        years
                        of life, after a
                        period of apparent normality, and is caused by mutations in the <b>MeCP2 gene</b> (Ethel
                        cpg-binding
                        protein 2) located in the
                        X chromosome.<br>
                        Symptoms of Rett syndrome can typically include <b>loss of verbal and motor skills, repetitive
                            hand
                            movements, breathing
                            problems, seizures, and scoliosis</b>; the severity of symptoms can vary considerably and
                        symptoms
                        similar to those of the
                        diagnostic category of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) begin to manifest.<br>
                        Currently there is no cure for this disease; however, there are treatments available to manage
                        the
                        symptoms and improve
                        the quality of life of people with Rett syndrome. In most cases, the diagnosis is confirmed by
                        molecular genetic testing,
                        thus avoiding a misdiagnosis of autism, as was frequently the case in the past.<br>
                        <br>
                        In recent years a lot of data has been collected, following studies based on human and mouse
                        tests;
                        raw input data of
                        these studies are freely available on public archives, such as
                        <b>Sequence Read Archive (<a id="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra"
                                target="_blank">SRA</a>)</b>, managed by the <b>National Center for Biotechnology
                            Information (<a id="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">NCBI</a>).
                        </b><br>
                        These data represent a wealth of information for further global and integrative retrospective
                        analysis. To identify
                        applied biological processes and reveal possible genes responsible for this genetic mutation, we
                        have created a <a id="link" href="./../Dataset/Bioproject/bioproject-table.html"><b>Bioproject
                                Detail
                                section</b></a>
                        where you can load your own file of transcriptomic data with RNA sequences of subjects with Rett
                        syndrome subjected to
                        various tests and compare the results with better visualization.<br>
                        Since each of the laboratories producing these data sets has analyzed their data following
                        different
                        protocols (e.g. in
                        terms of software, genomic versions and many other features), the data has been arranged in this
                        web
                        portal to allow
                        easy viewing, comparison, <a id="link" href="/">interrogation</a> and <a id="link"
